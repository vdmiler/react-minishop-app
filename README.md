Showcase of an online store, which is constantly updated

In this project I mastered:

* React
* react-create-app
* redux toolkit
* react-router-dom
* material-ui

All components are in the src folder. All another files was generated by react-create-app

You can run this project locally just do:

* clone branch review with git clone https://github.com/vdmiler/newsletter-app.git or fork it and then clone it from your forked repo
* cd react-minishop-app
* npm install
* npm start
